DrivingRangeApp takes 3 command-line arguments in the form <number of golfers> <size of the main stash> <size of each golfer's bucket>
Example: java DrivingRangeApp 3 20 5

The program will then prompt you to choose between running with or without the extended functionality (as explained in my report).
I recommend running it without the extension when marking against the basic requirements and then running with the extension when
marking for extra credit.

The makefile supports "make clean" and "make". There is no "make run" because the invocation requires command-line arguments.

I spent a lot of time on my program. I hope that my thorough commenting (for your convenience) and efficient
code doesn't go unnoticed.

My git archive is a remote repository on GitHub. 

Have a great day.
